Program: 12 A company organizes events on even days of the month, from day 1 to day 100. 
The management wants to calculate the total budget allocated for these events. 
Each even day costs 200 Rs. Write a C program to compute the total budget 
allocated for all even-day events. 
Code: // Practical 12: Find Budget For Even Days 
 
#include <stdio.h> 
void main() 
{ 
    int day,sum=0; 
    // Taking Days From User For Find Budge 
    printf("NOTE=Every Even Day Cost Is 200 rs\n\n\n"); 
    printf("Enter The Days For That You Want To Find Budget::"); 
    scanf("%d",&day); 
    //Here Loop Use For Calculate Budget For Entered Days 
    for(int i = 1 ; i<=day ; i++) 
    { 
        //Here Condition Stands For Check That The Day Is Even Or Odd 
        if (i%2 == 0) 
        { 
            sum = sum +200; 
        } 
    } 
    printf("The Management Allocate %d rs For That Event\n\n\n\n" ,sum); 
     
printf("24ce032_TARANG");
}
